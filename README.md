# Movie-recommendation-system
This project uses Selenium to extract 2024 IMDb movie names and storylines, processes them with NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer), and applies Cosine Similarity to recommend movies with similar plots. A Streamlit app lets users input a storyline and get the top 5 similar movies with scores and summaries.
